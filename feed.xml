        <title>The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://tellmemore.life/assets/images/17.jpg" alt="The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking.</title>

          &lt;p&gt;You are jekyll  offline!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-formatting&quot;&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;#special-formatting&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;octicon octicon-link&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Special formatting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;strike through&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;==highlight==&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;*escaped characters*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-code-blocks&quot;&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;#writing-code-blocks&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;octicon octicon-link&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Writing code blocks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/code&gt;. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;walking&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reference-lists&quot;&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;#reference-lists&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;octicon octicon-link&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reference lists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quick brown jumped over the lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;full-html&quot;&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/d-ogarkov/jekyll-extlinks/blob/master/lib/jekyll-extlinks.rb&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;octicon octicon-link&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Full HTML&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>About Bundler</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://tellmemore.life/assets/images/2.jpg" alt="About Bundler" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem install bundler&lt;/code&gt; installs the bundler gem through RubyGems. You only need to install it once - not every time you create a new Jekyll project. Here are some additional details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundler&lt;/code&gt; is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile.lock&lt;/code&gt; files inform &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/code&gt; about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec&lt;/code&gt; and just &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;run jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/code&gt; uses the gems and versions as specified in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Gemfile.lock&lt;/code&gt; to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about how to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/code&gt; in your Jekyll project, this tutorial should provide answers to the most common questions and explain how to get up and running quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>We all wait for summer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://tellmemore.life/assets/images/1.jpg" alt="We all wait for summer" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is changed. As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the “brethren” think that &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;education should equip&lt;/a&gt; them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Press and education</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://tellmemore.life/assets/images/7.jpg" alt="Press and education" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education must also train one for quick, &lt;strong&gt;resolute and effective thinking&lt;/strong&gt;. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Options for creating a new site with Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://tellmemore.life/assets/images/13.jpg" alt="Options for creating a new site with Jekyll" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll new &amp;lt;PATH&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; installs a new Jekyll site at the path specified (relative to current directory). In this case, Jekyll will be installed in a directory called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;myblog&lt;/code&gt;. Here are some additional details:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To install the Jekyll site into the directory you’re currently in, run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll new&lt;/code&gt; . If the existing directory isn’t empty, you can pass the –force option with jekyll new . –force.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll new&lt;/code&gt; automatically initiates &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt; to install the dependencies required. (If you don’t want Bundler to install the gems, use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll new myblog --skip-bundle&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By default, the Jekyll site installed by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll new&lt;/code&gt; uses a gem-based theme called Minima. With gem-based themes, some of the directories and files are stored in the theme-gem, hidden from your immediate view.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We recommend setting up Jekyll with a gem-based theme but if you want to start with a blank slate, use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll new myblog --blank&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To learn about other parameters you can include with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll new&lt;/code&gt;, type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll new --help&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

From my earliest pebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to this world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So begins Hallam Hawksworth’s The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been through fire and water, I tell you! From my earliest pebblehood the wildest things you could imagine have been happening to this world of ours, and I have been right in the midst of them.&lt;/p&gt;
